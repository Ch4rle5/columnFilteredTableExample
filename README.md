# columnFilteredTableExample
Simple application to present the library [libColumnFilteredTable](https://github.com/Ch4rle5/libColumnFilteredTable)

An illustration is better than words
|whole dataset|filtered data|
|---|---|
|![Image of a table with non filtered data](.github/illustrations/nonFilteredTable.png?raw=true)|![Image of a table with filtered data](.github/illustrations/filteredTable.png?raw=true)|

## Notes
The library is a submodule of this app => git clone submodule...<br/>
The filtering row is not yet fixed at the top.<br/>
Some optimisations are probably needed (for example the whole table is reseted when a filter changes).<br/>
